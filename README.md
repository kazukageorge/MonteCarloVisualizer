# Approximating Pi

## Tech Stack
### Frontend
* React
* Ploly.js
* Axios

### Backend
* Django
* Django Rest 

 
## Description
Monte Carlo simulation is a method used to approximate numerical values. One example is approximating π.

Sample random number from [-1,1] from a uniform distribution and check if it lies inside/outside the unit circle. Approximate π using the area of the circle and the square from [-1,1]
